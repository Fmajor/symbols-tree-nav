# symbols-tree-nav package

Symbols Tree View for Atom.io, just like taglist or tagbar for VIM.

tag-generator.coffee comes from http://github.com/atom/symbols-view

**Disclaimer** This is a fork from https://atom.io/packages/symbols-tree-view. I am not the original author. symbols-tree-nav only offers some more options, but be warned I am no coffee script expert, so they may be experimental! At least, I use this package and it works at home. PR are welcome! Also, new contributors are welcome.

Another fork, without any extra options, but fixes for deprecations warnings, is available at https://atom.io/packages/symbols-tree-view-fix.

Rest of this README is so far same as original (but should be enhanced in a next version).
